# MedAI: Transparency in Medical Image Segmentation

# What is this repo
This repo contains the code and experiments that are implemented to contribute in MedAI Cahllenge: Transparency in Medical Image Segmentation to automate medical image segmentation while preserve transparency. In the paper below we proposed generative adversarial network-based models to segment both polyps and instruments in endoscopy images. We also provide explanations for the predictions using a layer-wise relevance propagation approach.
